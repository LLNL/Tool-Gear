Tool Gear Change Log

2.02                  Sept 8, 2006
----------------------------------
Fixed corner case in memcheckview's parsing of Valgrind's XML output that
would cause the an invalid address not to be displayed if the address
was not near anything known (the no traceback case).  The last line of
an error message of the following form was not always displayed:
  Address 0x2FF22FF4 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd

Tweaked selected text display to use fixed selection foreground and background
colors instead of reversing the text color (affects all tools).


2.01                 July 19, 2006
----------------------------------
Minor update that allows text to be selected with the left mouse button in the
message viewer (and thus added to the X11 selection clipboard).  

Fixed line number annotation so it no longer messes up tab alignment in the
source display.

Fixes some minor typos found while writing the web documentation found at 
www.llnl.gov/computing/memcheck. 

Initial support for mpiP 3.0 integrated.


2.00                March 29, 2006
----------------------------------
Major new Tool Gear release with a new xml-based interface that allows 
GUIs to be created quickly with Tool Gear in any programming or
scripting language.  Detailed documentation on how to create new tools
using Tool Gear 2.00's xml interface can be found in CREATING_NEW_TOOLS.

The full Tool Gear 2.00 tarball also includes the initial public release of 
three new GUI interfaces (memcheckview, umpireview, and dynTG) as well as 
enhanced mpipview support for huge (145MB+) mpiP output files from BG/L.
By popular demand, Tool Gear is now providing tar balls of individual 
tools (i.e., just mpipview or memcheckview) as well as for all the tools 
in one tar ball at www.llnl.gov/CASC/tool_gear.

Demos of the GUIs for mpipview, memcheckview, and umpireview can be found in
demos/TGui (and don't require the mpiP, valgrind, or Umpire to be installed).
See demos/TGui/README for details on how to run the demos.

Updated BSD license and copyright notice placed in all files
on April 28, 2006 prior to external release of Tool Gear 2.00.

Here is a brief description of the tool GUIs and scripts available in 
Tool Gear 2.00:


mpipview provides a GUI for the popular lightweight, scalable MPI profiling 
tool 'mpiP' (www.llnl.gov/CASC/mpip) and now supports mpiP 2.9.


memcheckview provides a GUI for Valgrind's popular heavy-weight memory tool 
memcheck (requires valgrind 3.0.1 or later).  Valgrind documentation,
downloads, etc. can be found at valgrind.org.

memcheck is a script that runs Valgrind's memcheck tool on serial applications
with the memcheckview GUI displaying valgrind's warnings as they are found.

memcheck_all is a script that runs valgrind on parallel MPI applications and
includes support for valgrind's new MPI wrappers which dramatically 
reduces false positives for MPI applications.  To use the new MPI wrappers,
you will need to set MPI_WRAPPERS to the appropriate path in the 
memcheck_all script.  memcheckview is used to view the output files 
generated by memcheck_all.


umpireview provides a GUI for viewing the output of Umpire, an MPI wrapper 
library that detects unsafe or erroneous MPI usage written by 
Bronis de Supinski, John May, Jeff Vetter, Chris Chambreau, and 
Martin Schulz at LLNL. (A web page to download Umpire from LLNL 
is expected soon.)


DynTG is a tool for interactive, dynamic instrumentation of either
serial or parallel applications written by Martin Schulz, John May,
and John Gyllenhaal at LLNL.  DynTG relies on DPCL for instrumentation
and is currently only supported on AIX (other ports are in progress).



1.30             September 1, 2004
----------------------------------
Release of mpipview 1.2 which fully supports all the new features of
mpiP 2.7 including MPI I/O statistics.

Numerous Tool Gear enhancements including the ability to stop long
recursive searches for source code, handling of directory loops caused
by symbolic links when searching for source code, the ability to
specify multiple tracebacks for a message, a new tabbed view for
message tracebacks, performance enhancements for the DPCL-based tool
tgmpx, and support for using search paths to find source files in
tgmpx, (as in mpipview).

Also fixes all reported bugs for earlier versions of Tool Gear.
Using Qt 3.3.3 instead of earlier versions for this release fixes some
graphical problems on Macs, but it breaks drag-and-drop in the search
path dialog.  Both Qt versions appear to work fine on most non-Mac
platforms.

Support for multiple tracebacks required changing the
UIManager::addMessage API, so calls to this API (and the related
support functions) will need to be adjusted. 


1.22 (internal)      July 23, 2004
----------------------------------
An internal release containing initial support for the mpiP 2.7 beta.

1.21                 June 25, 2004
----------------------------------
Release of mpipview 1.1, which fixed some mpiP 2.6 output parser
corner cases, added some enhancements to indicate when only some tasks
reach an MPI call, and fixed some minor bugs.


1.20                April 30, 2004
----------------------------------
Initial release of Tool Gear's portable "message viewer" tool
infrastructure.  Designed for quick creation of powerful GUI's for
organizing and displaying text output from various performance and
debugging tools.  These message viewer tools should run on any Unix
system that Qt 3.3.1 (www.trolltech.com) supports (no DPCL required).

Includes the new tool mpipview 1.0 which displays the results of the
MPI profiling tool mpiP (www.llnl.gov/CASC/mpip).   Supports mpiP
versions 1.5 and 1.6 and has been verified to work on AIX 5.1, MacOS X,
x86/linux (RedHat EL3), and Tru64 (OSF1 V5.1).  
 
This version of Tool Gear includes many enhancements, including the
ability to recursively search directories for source code and
significant performance improvements.


1.10 (beta)          April 9, 2003
----------------------------------
A much more robust and performance tuned release of Tool Gear's
DPCL-based instrumentation tool infrastructure.   The tool tgmpx was
enhanced to include time measurements, and much more documentation
was provided.

(Requires enhanced DPCL scheduled for release June 2003 in order to
handle moderately large programs.)


1.00 (beta)         August 5, 2002
----------------------------------
Initial beta release of Tool Gear's DPCL-based instrumentation tool 
infrastructure.   Includes tgmpx (measures FLOP count, FLOP rate,
and cache utilization) and breakpoint support.
