Boost Files

16 September 2004

This directory contains a subset of the boost library that
implements shared_ptr templates.  Boost is a freely-available
open source library; see www.boost.org for details.  The source
code in this directory is covered by the license in the file
LICENSE_1_0.txt.  Although the Tool Gear project did not write
and does not support the software in this directory, we have
included it in the Tool Gear distribution as a convenience for
users.  You may also download your own copy of the boost library
and adjust the Makefiles (currenly only in DPCLcollector) to
point to that.

All the files that Tool Gear needs from this directory are C++
header files, so nothing here needs to be compiled separately or
linked explicitly into an executable.

The files in this directory are extracted from boost version
1.31.0.
